Here is the background information on your task
Architecture design is the task architects are famous for. Sometimes architects get a clean slate and have the opportunity to suggest the best design they can think of. But very often the system itself already exists, and new features must be built upon the existing base. Or the system itself might be new, but needs to use existing elements, for example old databases.

Another very typical task in software development is to review the work of others. Developers and architects constantly review work of their colleagues. This habit helps to ensure that the work items are of good quality.
